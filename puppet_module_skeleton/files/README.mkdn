Files
=====

Define static files in this directory.

The puppet master service includes a file server for transferring static files.
If a file resource declaration contains a puppet: URI in its source attribute,
nodes will retrieve that file from the masterâ€™s file server:

    file { "/etc/sudoers":
        mode => 440,
        owner => root,
        group => root,
        source => "puppet:///modules/module_name/sudoers"
    }

If a server hostname is omitted (i.e. puppet:///{mount point}/{path}; note the
triple-slash), the URI will resolve to whichever server the evaluating node
considers to be its master. As this makes manifest code more portable and
reusable, hostnames should be omitted whenever possible

See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/file_serving.html for more details.
